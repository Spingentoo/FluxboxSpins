 ====================
  What does this do?
 ====================

  This program will automatically format a partition and perform a series of steps to install Latest Minimal Gentoo Release.
  Make sure the partition you want to use is atleast 4-5 GB

 ==================
  How do I use it?
 ==================

 1) Boot from Gentoo Live DVD/CD or Any running Linux System like Ubuntu/Debian or another Gentoo :-) 

 2) Download Gentoo Install Script

 3) Run the install script

  ./install-0.1.sh

  This will invoke 001-gentoo-install-x86_64_stage3.sh script and setup your device partition for stage3 based installation.

 4) Run the chroot script

   ./chroot2Gentoo-0.1.sh

 5) Run the Gentoo Stage 3 configuration script now.

   ./002-gentoo-configure-x86_64_stage3.sh 

TODO:

a) Support for additional packages.
b) Increase interactive behaviour.
c) Kernel Modules auto-detection.
